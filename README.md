Adept - the adaptive JPG Compressor
====================

## Quick Start

* Remember: Adept is a **Linux commandline tool**
* Make sure you have [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/), [Jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim) and [JPEGrescan](https://github.com/kud/jpegrescan) installed & useable. All but JPEGrescan are available in all major Linux distributions.
* Fetch a copy of [adept.sh](https://raw.github.com/technopagan/adept-jpg-compressor/master/adept.sh) and place it somewhere you deem a good place for 3rd party shellscripts, e.g. "/usr/local/bin". Make sure the location is in the PATH of the user(s) who will run adept.sh and ensure that the script is executable (chmod -x).
* Congratulations! You can now run "bash adept.sh /path/to/image.jpg" to compress JPEGs 3-5% more successfully. 


## Introduction

When compressing JPEG images, the same compression level is used on the entire image. However, most JPEG images contain homogeneous and heterogeneous areas, which are varyingly well-suited for compression. Compressing heterogeneous areas in JPEGs to reduce filesize causes [compression artefacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_artifact) due to the lossy nature of JPEG compression.

This script adaptively alters the compression level for areas within JPEGs to achieve optimal filesize while maintaining decent visual quality. Currently, this script achieves an average 3-5% of reduced filesize compared to standard CLI tools such as jpegoptim while still maintaining good visual quality. This is primarily interesting for the [#WebPerf](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WebPerf&src=typd) community.

Note that adaptive JPEG compression is already implemented in tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Fireworks. This script brings adaptive JPEG compression to the shell using common console tools already installed on many machines dealing with automated image optimization. The script is save to use as ELA, the [Error Level Analysis Algorithm](http://fotoforensics.com/tutorial-ela.php), does [not flag the images as tainted](http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=9955933a9ea6774a0e58303db1ac104af8dafd41.107232).

## Adept Workflow

[![Adept Workflow Diagram](images/adept-workflow.jpg)](https://raw.github.com/technopagan/adept-jpg-compressor/master/images/adept-workflow.jpg)
Adept works by splitting up the input image into tiles of equal size and then running the [Sobel Edge Detection algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator) on them. The Sobel tiles are then reduced to two colors to make the black & white pixels in each tile easily countable. 

The ratio of black & white pixels in each tile is the decisive factor for exposing a tile to default or higher compression rates. After all tiles are processed and possibly more heavily compressed in this manner, they are reassembled into the output image.

## Image Demos

### On The Beach

**GIMP, Save For Web Plugin, Quality 85 - 112,7 kB**
[![Beach GIMP SaveForWeb q85](images/01-01-beach-gimp-saveforweb-q85.jpg)](https://raw.github.com/technopagan/adept-jpg-compressor/master/images/01-01-beach-gimp-saveforweb-q85.jpg)
GIMP's Save for Web, q85, optimized, Basline & stripped EXIF is the base configuration for all of our test images.

**JPEGOptim --max=85 -t -v --strip-all + lossless JPEGRescan - 110,4 kB**
[![Beach JPEGOptim plus JPEGRescan](images/01-02-beach-jpegoptim-q85-stripall-plus-jpegrescan.jpg)](https://raw.github.com/technopagan/adept-jpg-compressor/master/images/01-02-beach-jpegoptim-q85-stripall-plus-jpegrescan.jpg)
Using popular commandline tools for JPG compression, we can achieve a 2.04% smaller filesize with no perceivable loss in quality.

**Adept - 107,2 kB**
[![Beach Adept](images/01-03-beach_adept_compress.jpg)](https://raw.github.com/technopagan/adept-jpg-compressor/master/images/01-03-beach_adept_compress.jpg)
With Adept, the filesize is reduced by 4.88%. Slight artefacts can be perceived when zooming in closely on the horizon's blue gradiant because Adept identified the sky as an area of low complexity and thus compressed it more heavily. No artifacts are present at any of the key areas of the image, however (parasol, canvas chair, horizon border, sea-to-sand border etc). 

**Adobe Fireworks + @pornelski's ImageOptim - 106,9 kB**
[![Beach Adobe Fireworks and ImageOptim](images/01-04-beach-Adobe-Fireworks-plus-ImageOptim-identical-quality-settings.jpg)](https://raw.github.com/technopagan/adept-jpg-compressor/master/images/01-04-beach-Adobe-Fireworks-plus-ImageOptim-identical-quality-settings.jpg)
The commercial Adobe suite, combined with postprocessing by [ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com/) by [@pornelski](https://twitter.com/pornelski), both set to identical quality settings as the other tools, produces the best result: 5.01% filesize reduction while the horizon's blue gradiant features fewer compression artefacts. Impressive! Sadly, this is not automatable at scale.

**JPEGMini - 98,4 kB**
[![Beach JPEGMini](images/01-05-beach-jpegmini.jpg)](https://raw.github.com/technopagan/adept-jpg-compressor/master/images/01-05-beach-jpegmini.jpg)
The big noise of 2011. JPEGMini claimed they reinvented JPEG compression while not breaking the ISO standard. And Yes, the image created by JPEGMini features a whoppin filesize reduction of 12.68%. Sadly, it is also the image with the most visible compression artefacts, also around the key areas of the image. There also is a severe loss of detail on the waves as well as the sand.

### The Satchel

**GIMP, Save For Web Plugin, Quality 85 - 76,1 kB**
[![Satchel GIMP SaveForWeb q85](images/05-01-satchel-gimp-saveforweb-q85.jpg)](https://raw.github.com/technopagan/adept-jpg-compressor/master/images/05-01-satchel-gimp-saveforweb-q85.jpg)
Again, GIMP Save for Web, q85, optimized, Basline & stripped EXIF. This image was chosen specifically for [@mikebrittain](https://twitter.com/mikebrittain) of [Etsy's Engineering Team](https://twitter.com/codeascraft) because they are [batch-processing tons of leather satchel images](http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2010/07/09/batch-processing-millions-of-images/) daily. ;)

**JPEGOptim --max=85 -t -v --strip-all + lossless JPEGRescan - 75,5 kB**
[![Satchel JPEGOptim plus JPEGRescan](images/05-02-satchel-jpegoptim-q85-stripall-plus-jpegrescan.jpg)](https://raw.github.com/technopagan/adept-jpg-compressor/master/images/05-02-satchel-jpegoptim-q85-stripall-plus-jpegrescan.jpg)
Using popular commandline tools, we achieve only a 0.78% smaller filesize without perceivable loss in quality.

**Adept - 68,4 kB**
[![Satchel Adept](images/05-03-satchel_adept_compress.jpg)](https://raw.github.com/technopagan/adept-jpg-compressor/master/images/05-03-satchel_adept_compress.jpg)
Adept reduces the image filesize by 10.12%! This is possible thanks to the large dark areas on the lefthand side of the image. The only visible compression artefacts caused by Adept are located in the bright patch of out-of-focus wall far behind the satchel.

**Adobe Fireworks + @pornelski's ImageOptim - 69,1 kB**
[![Satchel Adobe Fireworks and ImageOptim](images/05-04-satchel-Adobe-Fireworks-plus-ImageOptim-identical-quality-settings.jpg)](https://raw.github.com/technopagan/adept-jpg-compressor/master/images/05-04-satchel-Adobe-Fireworks-plus-ImageOptim-identical-quality-settings.jpg)
Adobe Fireworks + ImageOptim save 9.19% of filesize. While this makes the resulting image a little larger than the version created by Adept, one has to consider that the Adobe version handles the noise in the off-focus background more gracefully, therefore again taking the crown of balance between filesize and visual quality. Once more, it's sadly not automatable and wouldn't scale well.

**JPEGMini - 56,7 kB**
[![Beach JPEGMini](images/05-05-satchel-jpegmini.jpg)](https://raw.github.com/technopagan/adept-jpg-compressor/master/images/05-05-satchel-jpegmini.jpg)
JPEGMini achieves 25.48% smaller filessize on the leather satchel image. Again, this comes at a cost of reduced visual quality: the leather texture in the foreground, esp. on high contrast areas such as the belt or the handlebar, becomes blurry and loses contrast.
